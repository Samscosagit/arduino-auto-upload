Blinks the built-in LED on and off 12 times with a one-second delay for each state. Prints the LED state to the serial monitor. After 12 blinks, it waits for 5 seconds before repeating the sequence. Includes a preprocessor directive to define LED_BUILTIN if not already defined.

Pins used:
- LED_BUILTIN (defaults to 13 if not otherwise defined)
